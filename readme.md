**React Issue**

- class components → cannot use hooks

- useMemo, useCallback

- promise call multiple in array

- useEffect in child component when parent component also has useEffect to call api → mostly in isLoading

**Map and filter**

map→ iterate throught Array and also make a copy of it and return an array.

filter→ filters data from array and return an array .
